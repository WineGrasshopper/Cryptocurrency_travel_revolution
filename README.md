# Cryptocurrency travel revolution: Unraveling the mystery of consumer trust in market environment volatile

## Abstract
This study analyzed factors influencing consumer trust in cryptocurrency-based Online Travel Agencies (OTAs), focusing on trust dynamics and market volatility. Study 1, using qualitative content analysis, identified functional, emotional, and conditional values in OTAs. Study 2 employed PLS-SEM to confirm the positive impact of these values on platform and cryptocurrency trust, and examined the moderating effects of market volatility and digital financial literacy. Study 3 utilized RSA (Response Surface Analysis) to find that trust imbalances negatively affected continuance intention. The research underscored the need for OTAs to implement trust-building strategies and educational programs to enhance digital financial literacy, offering new insights into the interplay between trust and digital assets in volatile markets

## Methodology
Data Collection:
- Online reviews from Trustpilot for cryptocurrency-based Online Travel Agencies (OTAs)
- 30,499 reviews initially collected, 20,826 reviews after cleaning
- 2,000 reviews randomly sampled for content analysis

Analysis:
- Study 1: Qualitative content analysis using MAXQDA 24.0

## Key Findings
Identified three main categories of experiential values in cryptocurrency-based OTAs:
- Functional value
- Emotional value
- Conditional value

Developed and validated a theoretical model showing:
- Positive relationships between experiential value, platform trust, cryptocurrency trust, and continuance use intention
- Moderating effects of market environment volatility and digital financial literacy
- Interaction effects between platform trust and cryptocurrency trust on continuance use intention

## Implications
Theoretical:
- Advances understanding of experiential value in cryptocurrency-based OTAs
- Extends trust transfer theory to complex, multi-platform business models
- Introduces market volatility and digital financial literacy as key moderating factors

Practical:
- Guides OTAs in designing platforms that offer functional, emotional, and conditional value
- Emphasizes the importance of trust-building strategies
- Suggests strategies for managing market volatility and enhancing digital financial literacy

## Limitations and Future Research
- Data collected only from Amazon Mechanical Turk and focused on U.S. citizens
- Limited to specific cryptocurrency-based OTA platforms
